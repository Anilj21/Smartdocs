          "summary": "The provided text is a collection of notes on various topics related to Bitcoin and blockchain technology. Here's a breakdown of the main points covered:\n\n**Bitcoin Basics**\n\n* Bitcoin mining refers to ensuring that transactions are valid and added to the Bitcoin blockchain correctly using a global network of computers running the Bitcoin code.\n* The process of mining involves verifying new transactions against the Bitcoin network, which results in the production of new bitcoin.\n\n**Block Propagation**\n\n* Block propagation time or block propagation delay determines the limits of Bitcoin’s scaling.\n* It's an average time that is needed for the new block to reach the majority of nodes in the network.\n* Researchers have found that for blocks larger than 20kB, the block propagation delay is nearly proportional to the block size.\n\n**Bitcoin Network**\n\n* The Bitcoin P2P network is formed of miner nodes where the nodes randomly connect with each other.\n* Transactions and blocks are transmitted over this network by these nodes until each has received the message.\n* The diffusion increases exponentially as the hops increase, and after 12–15 hops, the entire network receives the message.\n\n**Block Propagation on Network Plane**\n\n* Blockchain throughput is measured by the number of transactions per second that it can support.\n* The current Block capacity for Bitcoin is 1MB for a Block interval of 10 minutes and given the average transaction size of nearly 540 bytes, the Bitcoin network currently processes ~1950 transactions per Block, which translates to ~3 transactions per second (TPS).\n\n**Bitcoin Relay Network**\n\n* The Bitcoin Relay Network is a system of peering between nodes in the network by creating a system of high-speed relay nodes for miners and merchants/exchanges.\n* This system acts as a fall back in the case that the public Bitcoin network encounters issues and decreases block propagation times between miners.\n\nOverall, these notes provide an overview of various aspects of Bitcoin and blockchain technology, including mining, block propagation, and the Bitcoin Relay Network."

Using population parameters (e.g., mean and standard deviation).\n2. Requiring interval or ratio scales.\n3. Assumptions about the underlying distribution (e.g., normal distribution).\n\n**Non-Parametric Test Procedures:**\n\nNon-parametric tests do not require specific conditions about the shape of populations or population parameters.\n\n**Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test (Mann-Whitney Utest):**\n\nThis is a non-parametric test used to assess whether two samples come from the same distribution. It requires independent observations and ordinal or continuous measurements.\n\n**Specific Questions:**\n\nIf you have any specific questions about statistical tests or data types, please let me know, and I'll do my best to answer them."
